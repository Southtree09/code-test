# Southtree Code Screen

This repository is intended as a basic code screen for applicants for developer positions here at southtree.  I fully expect applicants to use the internet if they get stuck or need help, indeed part of the screen is the ability to solve problems effectively.

Examples are intentionally minimal, your time is valuable.
